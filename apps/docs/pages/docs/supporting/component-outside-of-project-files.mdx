title: Component Outside of Project Files
---

This file lives outside of your declared project file in [your config](/docs/get-started/settings), meaning Triplex won't be able to find it when opening files.

To resolve, either:

1. Update your config to include the folder the component is inside:

   <MetaDiff source="files" target="path" action="add" transform="glob" />

2. Move the file underneath one of the directories defined in the `files` property of your config:

   <PickMeta pick="files" />

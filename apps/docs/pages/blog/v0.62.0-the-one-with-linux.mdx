- Component thumbnails are now available in the open component / add component

- The view camera action in the scene panel is now a toggle button, click once

## Bug fixes

- Editing children elements now opens the elements file as a tab if not yet open
  [[#165](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/issues/165)]
- Fix "save as" breaking HMR
  [[#156](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/issues/156)]
- Triplex now finds random open ports every time a project is opened instead of
  using hardcoded ones
- Saving files outside of the project folder is now presented with an error
  message preventing the save, instead of allowing the save and then being
  presented with an exception
- Finding a Triplex config when opening a project now stops when getting to the
  root directory instead of going forever on Windows
- Fix IDE links (view source / view usage) not opening in some scenarios
- Open project modals are now tied to a browser window when available

## Chores

- Triplex now finds random open ports every time a project is opened instead of
  using hardcoded ones [[#64](https://github.com/trytriplex/triplex/issues/64)]
- Background color of the scene is now a smooth gradient
- The React Three Fiber renderer has been refactored to remove some dependencies
